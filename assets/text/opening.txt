Paul the genious geologist has stumbled upon a new town rich with awesome rocks and gem resources! 
The towns people have been generous enough to let Paul dig around as much as he wants as long as he 
continues to provide their town with power. 
The Mega Gear in the factory provides electricty to the homes in town. 
Dig around to find as many resources/gems as you can but make sure to keep the gear running so
that the town stays powered during your excavation.
